    Something I learned in this class (Computer Science) is how to make a general format for a website. Meaning how to make links work, and how to out headings on the top of your page.
    <br>
    My advice for future ECS students, is to make sure that you know what you are doing. If you don't know something, just ask Mr.Heo or whomever your teacher will be, and they will probably tell you whats wrong and then they'll try to help
