    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is Zachary Makowski.
      <li>I was born in Chicago, Illinois on January 10<sup>th</sup> 2004.
      <li>My name was given to me by my mom who just wanted a name not many had, and a name that sounded nice.
      <li>I live in Dunning.
      </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>My childhood</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I attended Oriole Park School.
      <li>My favorite story from my early days, was when I went to the nurse's office in kindergarten, and couldn't pronounce my last name in english.
      <li>My first friend ever was Alex, who was my moms friend's son.
      <li>I like to play video games in my free time.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>High School</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I take these classes: Geometry, PE, AP Wolrd History, Biology, English, Spanish 1, and Computer Science.
      <li>I play piano and I swim.
      <li>My favorite thing about highschool is about everyone being older and the new freedom in school. One of my leat favorites is when you mess up one test and your whole grade drops like a whole letter or something.
      <li>I have many great friends in each class.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm not sure where I want to go for college, but probably out of state.
      <li>I'm not sure what I'm going to do in the future. Maybe something with math.
      <li>My goal right now is to finish high school and try to get good grades the whole time, meaning straight A's which already might not happen.
      <li>My desired location of residence is maybe somewhere warm or just stay in Chicago. Maybe Europe.
